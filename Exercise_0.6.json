browser->server: HTTP GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa
server-->browser: HTML-code
browser->server: HTTP GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.css
server-->browser: main.css
browser->server: HTTP GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa.js
server-->browser: spa.js

note over browser:
browser starts executing js-code
that requests JSON data from server 
end note

browser->server: HTTP GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
server-->browser: {content: "testing on 19-12", date: "2021-12-19T09:23:43.568Z"}

note over browser:
browser executes the event handler
that renders notes to display
end note
browser->server: HTTP POST  https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa

note over browser:
Post request to server contains the new note as JSON data,which has the Content-Type header allowing
the server to correctly parse the data
end note

server-->browser: Server responds with status code 201 (It will not ask for Redirects)

note over browser:
Since the server responded with status code 201, the browser stays on the same page and it sends
no more HTTP requests, instead it uses Javascript code that it pulled from the server. This code 
fetches the form-element from the page, and then registers an event handler to handle the
form submit event.
end note 

note over browser
Then the event handler creates a new note and adds it to the notes list with a command while
rerendering the note list on the page. It then sends the new note to the server.
end note
